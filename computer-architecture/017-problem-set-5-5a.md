# Problem Set #5

## Problem #1: 3.13
In this exercise, you will explore performance trade-offs between
three processors that each employ different types of multithreading. Each of
these processors is superscalar, uses in-order pipelines, requires a fixed threecycle stall following all loads and branches, and has identical L1 caches. Instructions from the same thread issued in the same cycle are read in program order and
must not contain any data or control dependences.
