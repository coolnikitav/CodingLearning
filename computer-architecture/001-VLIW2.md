# Scheduling Model Review
### VLIW Equals (EQ) Scheduling Model
- Each operation takes exactly specified latency
- Efficient register usage (Effectively more registers)
- No need for register renaming or buffering
  - Bypass from function unit output to inputs
  - Register writes whenever functional unit completes
- Compiler depends on not having registers visible early

### VLIW Less-Than-or-Equals (LEQ) Scheduling Model
- Each operation may take less than or equal to its specified latency
  - Destination can be written any time after instruction issue
  - Dependent instruction still needs to be scheduled after instruction latency
- Precise interrupts simplified
- Binary compatibility preserved when latencies are reduced

# Review of Predication
### VLIW Instruction Encoding
If VLIW is very big, you will need to fill it with a lot of nops to do simple instructions.
- Schemes to reduce effect of unused fields
  - Compressed format in memory, expand on l-cache refill
    - Used in Multiflow Trace
    - introduces instruction addressing challenge
- Mark parallel groups (mark where bundle starts and stops)
- Provide a single-op VLIW instruction
### Predication
Problem: Mispredicted branches limit ILP (OOO superscalar can handle it better by dynamically scheduling around branch mispredicts)

Solution: Eliminate hard to predict branches with predicated execution

Predication helps with small branch regions and/or branches that are hard to predict by turning control flow into data flow. You execute both sides and then pick the correct one with select.

Most basic form of predication: conditional moves
- movz rd,rs,rt if (R[rt} == 0) then R[rd] <- R[rs]
- movn rd,rst,rt if (R[rt] != 0) then R[rd] <- R[rs]

What if the if and the else statement have 1000 instructions in each of them? Then we would not want to predicate because we dont want to execute 2000 instructions.
### Full Predication
- Almost all instructions can be executed conditionally under predicate
- Instruction becomes NOP if predicate register false

If p1 == 1, executed instr 3. If it's 0, nullify it.

"(p1) instr3 || (p2) instr 5" means they are executing at the same time

# Predication Implementation
### Predicates and the Datapath

 - If the condition is not true, suppress the writeback:

- Bypassing value doesn't work!
  - Need initial value (extra read port on RF)
 
### Problems with Full Predication
- Adds another register file
- Need to bypass predicates
- Need original value to use data value bypassing

# Speculation Execution
### Leveraging Speculative Execution and Reacting to Dynamic Events in a VLIW
Speculation
- Moving instructions across branches
- Moving memory operations past other memory operations

Dynamic events:
- Cache miss
- Exceptions
- Branch mispredict

Code motion - reordering instructions to tolerate the latencies of instructions or to do something good (allignment issues, etc...)

### VLIW Speculative Execution
Problem: Branches restrict compiler code motion

Solution: Speculative operations that don't cause exceptions

### VLIW Data Speculation
Problem: Possible memory hazards limit code scheduling

Solution: Hardware to check pointer hazards

### ALAT (Advanced Load Address Table)
- load.a adds entry to ALAT
- Store removes entry if address/size match
- Check instruction (chk.a or ld.c) checks to make sure that address is still in ALAT and intermediary store did not push it out.
  - If not found, run recovery code (ex. re-execute load)

### VLIW Multi-Way Branches
Problem: Long instructions provide few opportunities for branches

Solution: allow one instruction to branch multiple directions

# Dynamic Events and Clustered VLIWs
### Scheduling Around Dynamic Events
- Cache Miss
  - Informing loads (loads nullify subsequent instructions)
  - Elbrus (Soviet/Russian) processor had branch on cache miss
- Branch Mispredict
  - Delay slots with predicated instructions
- Exceptions
  - Hard on superscalar also...
 
### Clustered VLIW
- Divide machine into clusters (local register files and local functional units)
- Lower bandwidth between clusters/Higher latency between clusters
- Used in:
  - HP/ST Lx Processor (printers)
  - TI C6x Series DSP
