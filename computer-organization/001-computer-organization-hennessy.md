1.6 Do the following changes to a computer system increase throughput, decrease
response time, or both?
  1. Replacing the processor in a computer with a faster version
  2. Adding additional processors to a system that uses multiple processors
for separate tasksâ€”for example, searching the web

- 1 would help decrease response time and increase throughput
- 2 would only increase throughput




1.5 A key factor in determining the cost of an integrated circuit is volume. Which of
the following are reasons why a chip made in high volume should cost less?

- With high volumes, the manufacturing process can be tuned to a particular
design, increasing the yield.
- The masks used to make the chip are expensive, so the cost per chip is lower
for higher volumes.
- Engineering development costs are high and largely independent of volume;
thus, the development cost per die is lower with high-volume parts.


1.4: Semiconductor DRAM memory, flash memory, and disk storage differ
significantly. For each technology, list its volatility, approximate relative
access time, and approximate relative cost compared to DRAM.

volatility       volatile        non-volatile     non-volatile           
access time      fast                medium        slow
cost              DRAM            cheaper than DRAM   cheaper than flash
