# VLSI 

IC  | | Num of transistors
--- | --- | ----
SSI | small-scale integration | 1 to 10
MSI | medium-scale integration | 10 to 500
LSI | large-scale integration | 500 to 20k
VLSI | very large-scale integration | 20k to 1m
ULSI? | ultra-large-scale integration | > 1m

## Advantages of CMOS
- Low power (low power dissipation)
- Fully restored logic levels (almost full 1 and full 0)
- On and Off times are similar
- High integration possible (can pack them closely and stack them)
- High performance

### Technology
Minimum feature size - channel length
