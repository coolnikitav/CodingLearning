- The DMA communicates with the CPU, memory, and peripherals over an AHB-lite bus. It acts as a slave to receive configuration data from the CPU and as a master to initiate transfers to and from peripherals and memory.
- Read controller reads from a source register and puts the data into a fifo.
- Write controller takes data from the fifo and writes it to the destination register.
- CPU writes to the registers in the DMA to configure its mode of operation. To write to the registers, the CPU needs to write to their memory mapping.
- DMA only uses non-cacheable regions of data to prevent coherency issues with CPU writing to cache.
