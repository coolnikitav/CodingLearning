## Approaches added to the toolset:

.238 Have a prefix and a suffix. Traverse the array and keep increasing them and multiplying into the output array.

.334 Set first and second int to max. Find a small number for first, the a bigger small number for second. Then if you find an even bigger number, there is a triplet.

.724 Find the sum of nums first.

.1071 GCD of string lengths.

.1493 We will keep a window and keep adding elements as long as the count of 0s in it doesn't exceed one. Once the number of 0s exceeds one, we will shrink the window from the left side till the count of 0 comes under the limit; then, we can compare the size of the current window with the longest subarray we have got so far.

.1679 Sort the array. You can also use a hash map, but the goal of the exercise is to use 2 pointers.

.1768 Traverse strings at the same time and check if index is smaller than string lengths.
