Note: You get a weak swing at X, but a full swing at F.

## PTL: Static Current In The Inverter

## PTL: Level Restorer

Note: make sure the level restorer does not beat N2. So make restorer weak or N2 strong

## PTL: Level Restorer Sizing
-Q: What happens if restorer width is too large or too small?

## Dynamic Logic: Properties
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25e9bd79-eded-40c4-9274-ae6350f47aac)

Note: extremely small short circuit current because clock rise/fall times are very sharp and small

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38573eab-9f62-4fa9-b8bd-71116695b557)

Note: dynamic always starts at Vdd, so alpha 2 is higher
