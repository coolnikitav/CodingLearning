## Obtaining Transient Response To A Step Input
- Q: What is the equation for V_OUT when V_IN goes from 0 to V_DD? What about when V_IN goes from V_DD to 0?

Note: it is assumed that the input is a step input.

## Obtaining Propagation Delay
- Q: Express the T_PHL and T-PLH in terms of resistances and capacitances.

## Obtaining Transient Response: A More Rigorous Approach
- Q: What is the equation for I_N in terms of Vout and C_L:
