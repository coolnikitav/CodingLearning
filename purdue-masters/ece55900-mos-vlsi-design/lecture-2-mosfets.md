# MOSFETs

## MOSFETs: Device Structure
- Q: Draw a diagram of an n-MOSFET? When is it on? When is it off? Where is the current flowing from and to?
- Q: Draw a diagram of an p-MOSFET? When is it on? When is it off? Where is the current flowing from and to?

- Substrate = body terminal
- n-MOSFET has electrons flowing
- p-MOSFET has holes flowing

## Band Diagrams: N-MOSFET
- Q: What is the equation for energy in this context?
- Q: What is DIBL?

- The leakage current increases due to DIBL.

We want the gate voltage to lower the barrier when the device is turned on:

- Q1: Where does the fermi level move when you dope a semiconductor with holes to make it p-type? n-type?
- Q2: What are we looking at? What do the lines mean? What does the rectangle/rhombus mean?

- A1: Fermi level will move closer to the valence band. n-type is the opposite: towards the conduction band.

- Q: What happens to the previous band diagram when Vgs > 0? Does it become more n-type or p-type? Why?

## Threshold Voltage (Vth)
- Q: At Vgs = Vth, what is the relationship between surface and bulk?
- Q: At threshold, what is the relationship between psi S and psi B?
