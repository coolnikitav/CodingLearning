# MOSFETs

## MOSFETs: Device Structure
- Q: Draw a diagram of an n-MOSFET? When is it on? When is it off? Where is the current flowing from and to?
- Q: Draw a diagram of an p-MOSFET? When is it on? When is it off? Where is the current flowing from and to?

- Substrate = body terminal
- n-MOSFET has electrons flowing
- p-MOSFET has holes flowing

## Band Diagrams: N-MOSFET
- Q: What is the equation for energy in this context?
- Q: What is DIBL?

- The leakage current increases due to DIBL.

We want the gate voltage to lower the barrier when the device is turned on.
