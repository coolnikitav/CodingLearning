## Backend Layers
- Q: Why is a low-k dialectric used?

- A: Because of low capacitance

## Interconnect Pitch
- Q: Why does the pitch increase when we go to higher layers?

- A: The higher layers are reserved for more global signals like power. They are longer (more resistance), so to lower resistance they are made wider

## Interconnect Parasitics
- Q: What are classes of parasitics?
- Q: What are some of the effects due to them?
- Q: What are the wire models?
- Q1: What is the lumped C model good for?

- A1: It is good to model a wire that is short because it ignores capacitance

## Capactitance: The Inter-Layer Parallel Plate Model
Big C is total capacitance. Small c is capacitance per unit length.

## Capacitance: Fringing Capacitance Model
- Q1: If you increase the aspect ratio, will the parallel plat or the fringing fields become more dominant?
