# CMOS Basics Part-2
Q1: Draw a diagram of an NPN MOSFET.
Q2: Explain the accumilation mode for NMOS. How does it happen?
Q3: Explain the depletion mode for NMOS.

For NMOS, When Vg < 0, holes accumulate near the metal oxide layer of the gate. 

If 0 < Vg < Vt, holes will start to repel from the accumulation region. This is depletion mode.

Now Vg > Vt. The electrons start to move from Vs to Vd (the current is drawn the opposite way). The inversion mode is created

# CMOS Basics Part-3
Q: Explain the body effect?
Q: Explain channel length modulation.

We bias the substrate to keep Vsb = 0V. If we do not bias it, then when it spikes to below 0, the gate voltage will not be enough to keep attracting electrons, basically raising the treshhold voltage.
