# Compiler

- Download GCC and Clang [here](https://winlibs.com/).

- Extract to C drive.

- Copy "C:\mingw64\bin", go to environment variables -> system variables -> path -> edit -> add the new variable.

- To test whether compilers are working: go to command prompt, "g++ --version", "clang++ --version".
