# What is sorting?

By definition, sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format: either ascending or descending.

Practical use of sorting:
- Microsoft excel: built in functionality to sort data
- Online shopping: price, data, review...

# Types of sorting
Space used:
- In place sorting: does not require any extra space for sorting (bubble sort)
- Out place sorting: requires extra spacing for sorting (merge sort)

Stability:
- Stable sorting: if there are duplicates, they remain in the same order (insertion sort)
- Unstable sorting: if there are duplicates, they may not remain in the same order (quick sort)
