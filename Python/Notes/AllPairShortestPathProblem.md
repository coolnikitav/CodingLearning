# What is single source shortest path?
A single source problem is about finding a path between a given vertex (called source) to all other vertices in a graph such that the total distance between them (source and destination) is minimum.

# What is all pair shortest path problem?
All pair shortest path problem is about finding a path between every vertex to all other vertices in a graph such that the total distance between them (source and destination) is minimum.
