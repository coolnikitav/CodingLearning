# A Recipe for Problem Solving

Algorithm: a set of steps to accomplish a certain task

5 steps:
- Understand the problem
- Explore examples
- Break it down
- Solve/simplify
- Look back and refactor

## Step 1 - Understand the problem
Questions to ask yourself:
- Can we restate the problem in our own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- What are the outputs that come from the problem?
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words do we have enough information to solve this problem?
- What should I label the important piece of data that are the part of the problem?

## Step 2 - Examples
- Start with simple examples
- Progress to more complex examples
- Explore examples with empty inputs
- Explore examples with invalid inputs

## Step 3 - Break it down
- Write out the steps you need to take

## Step 4 - Solve or Simplify
- Solve the problem. If you cannot... Simplify the problem
- Simplify the problem:
    - Find the core difficulty
    - Temporarily ignore that difficulty
    - Write a simplified solution
    - Then incorporate that difficulty
 
## Step 5 - Look back and refactor
- Can we check the result?
- Can we drive the result differently?
- Can we understand it at a glance?
- Can we use the result or method for some other problem?
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
- How do other people solve this problem?
