# Greedy Algorithms

- It is an algorithmic paradigm that builds the solution piece by piece
- In each step it chooses the piece that offers most obvious and immediate benefit
- It fits perfectly for those solutions in which local optimal solutions lead to global solution

## Greedy algorithm examples:
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort
- Topological sort
- Prim's algorithm
- Kruskal algorithm

## Problems solved with greedy algorithms:
- Activity selection problem
- Coin change problem
- Fractional knapsack problem
